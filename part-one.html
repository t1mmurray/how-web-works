1. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is one of the standard ways
in which computers communicate with one another. 2. URL stands for Universal
Resource Locator and is used to locate web pages. 3. DNS stands for Domain Name
System and is used to translate hostnames into IP addresses and vice versa. 4. A
query string is part of a URL and is comprised of any arguments passed along in
the URL. It's usually used in a GET request and searches. 5. The two most common
HTTP verbs are GET and POST. Both request data, but GET doesn't change the
server data while POST does. 6. An HTTP request is a method of communication and
data transfer between one or more computers and/or servers. The browser sends a
request to the web and a server receives that request. 7. An HTTP response is
the output or the return from a server back to the browser. Usually contains a
payload or response data. 8. An HTTP header is used to pass additional
information. Examples include Accept: text/html and Accept-Language: en-US 9.
The URL is translated into an IP addreess and an HTTP request is made and sent.
This request hopefully is followed by a response containing the html documents.
These documents might contain additional links or require additional HTTP
requests to be made. Then the browser renders the documents and displays the
webpage after receiving and compiling the data.
